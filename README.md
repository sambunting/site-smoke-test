# Site Smoke Test

Site Smoke Test is a CLI tool which looks at a website sitemap, and uses Playwright to ensure that no errors are thrown on each of the pages.

## Installation

To use, install the NPM package globally:

```sh
npm install -g site-smoke-test
```

Then, once installed - run `site-smoke-test` to see all available options.

## Basic Usage

To use the tool, pass through the URL to your site's sitemap.

```sh
site-smoke-test https://your-website.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Advanced Usage

### Reporting

You can customise how the reports are generated by passing through the names of each report using the `--reporters` flag:

```sh
site-smoke-test https://your-website.com/sitemap.xml --reporters console junit
```

### Configuration File

You can use a configuration file named `site-smoke-test.config.(json|yml|js)` to include configuration for the tool.

```json
{
  "sitemapURL": "https://your-website.com/sitemap.xml",
  "reporters": ["console", "junit"]
}
```

#### Configuration Hooks

These hooks are called at specific times while the tool is running. In order for you to use them, you need to use a `site-smoke-test.config.js` file.

```js
module.exports = {
  sitemapURL: 'https://dazzling-sherbet-63f829.netlify.app/sitemap.xml',

  beforeAll: (tests) => {
    // Before all of the tests are ran, log out the test object
    console.log(tests);
  }
}
```

##### beforeAll(tests: Tests[])
The `beforeAll` hook is called before all of the tests are ran.

##### afterAll(tests: Tests[])
The `afterAll` hook is called after all of the tests are ran.

##### beforePage(tests: Test)
The `beforePage` hook is called before a test is ran.

##### afterPage(tests: Test)
The `afterPage` hook is called after a test is ran.

You can also do things like modify the result of the test if required.
```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  afterPage: (test) => {
    // Here you might want to add some logic that would make the test pass or fail, such as if the test is on a specific path.

    // Force all of the tests to pass
    test.pass();

    // Alternatively - you can force all of the tests to fail.
    test.fail();
  }
}
```

## Development

### Todo
There are a few things I'd like to do before I fully release the project - these include:

- [x] - Additional Reporters
- [x] - Playwright customisation
- [ ] - Plugin/Extension support
- [x] - Add unit tests for the tool
