# Site Smoke Test

Site Smoke Test is a CLI tool which looks at a website sitemap, and uses Playwright to ensure that no errors are thrown on each of the pages.

## Installation

To use, install the NPM package globally:

```sh
npm install -g site-smoke-test
```

Then, once installed - run `site-smoke-test` to see all available options.

## Basic Usage

To use the tool, pass through the URL to your site's sitemap.

```sh
site-smoke-test https://your-website.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Advanced Usage

### Reporting

You can customise how the reports are generated by passing through the names of each report using the `--reporters` flag:

```sh
site-smoke-test https://your-website.com/sitemap.xml --reporters console junit
```

## Development

### Todo
There are a few things I'd like to do before I fully release the project - these include:

- [x] - Additional Reporters
- [ ] - Playwright customisation
- [ ] - Plugin/Extension support
- [ ] - Add unit tests for the tool
