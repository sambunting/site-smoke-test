# Contributing

First of all - thank you for considering to contribute to site-smoke-test! Improvements, bug fixes and new features are always welcome!

This guide will give you information on how you can help contribute to site-smoke-test.

## Some background

Before contributing, I'd like to give you some background on the tool, the purpose of it, and the overall scope of the tool.

site-smoke-test is designed to quickly inform developers if a site is working correctly in a browser. The way it works is by using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to check the console output for any errors that have been thrown. If there are errors, the tool will report on them. I created the as a quick and easy way to make sure an entire site isn't throwing any errors like 404 or runtime Javascript errors.

The tool is open source so that as many developers and organisations can make use of the tool as possible, as well as help improve my own skills as a programmer too!

One important thing to note, is that it is not a replacement for end to end automating tools like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). So testing specific functionality on specific pages isn't something site-smoke-test is designed to do, unlike tools like Cypress. You should ideally use site-smoke-test in addition to tools like Cypress, not as a replacement.

## Making changes

To make changes to the project - first clone the repo, and then install all the required dependencies by running `npm install`/`npm i`. 

While making changes, please ensure you are using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). 

Once you have finished making your changes, please open a pull request.

To ensure that the quality of the project and the changes you've made, there are several requirements that your code must meet before it can be merged.

1. The code must have no linting errors. (The project uses the [airbnb-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript) style guide)
2. All unit tests must pass
3. The project must be able to build.

A [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/sambunting/site-smoke-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/pull_request.yml) is in place to automatically test each pull request.
